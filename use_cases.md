# Kubernetes Jobs & CronJobs: Extended Use Cases

## Database Backups
- **Implementation**: CronJob runs at 1AM daily, exports DB, encrypts data, uploads to S3
- **Value**: Consistent point-in-time recovery with retention policies

## Application Updates
- **Implementation**: Job triggers rolling updates across microservices with validation gates
- **Value**: Controlled deployment with automatic rollback on failure 

## Auto-Healing
- **Implementation**: Job monitors pod health metrics, restarts unhealthy services
- **Value**: Reduces downtime by catching issues before they affect users

## Batch Processing
- **Implementation**: Job processes customer data exports in configurable batches
- **Value**: Handles large-scale operations without overwhelming system resources

## Financial Reconciliation
- **Implementation**: CronJob runs at market close to balance accounts and generate reports
- **Value**: Ensures time-sensitive financial calculations occur at precise intervals

## ETL Pipelines
- **Implementation**: CronJob extracts data from multiple sources, transforms, loads to warehouse
- **Value**: Automated data pipeline with failure handling and notifications

## Log Rotation
- **Implementation**: CronJob compresses older logs, archives to cold storage, frees space
- **Value**: Prevents disk space issues while maintaining compliance records

## Security Scans
- **Implementation**: CronJob scans container images and infrastructure for vulnerabilities
- **Value**: Regular security audits with minimal operational overhead

## Cache Warming
- **Implementation**: Job pre-populates caches after deployments or cache invalidations
- **Value**: Prevents performance degradation during cache rebuilding

## Cleanup Operations
- **Implementation**: CronJob purges temporary resources, orphaned volumes, stale data
- **Value**: Prevents resource leaks and reduces infrastructure costs
